# LangGraph-Basic-Project
Creating a LangGraph agentic workflow for stock interpretation powered by OpenAI API.
For simplicity, the values of the stocks are hard coded - future work may include th euse of a stock API to use live values and determine the agents capabilities. 
To run, you must create your own OpenAI API key and save it under .env.
